# Visual_tracking_demo
This project is a real-time visual tracking demo written in C, designed to run on Linux. It simulates two motors and implements a proportional controller for controlling their movements. The demo allows you to choose from three different backgrounds and various target colors to track. Additionally, you can change the type of movement by using the command section.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

* Linux operating system
* C compiler (GCC recommended)
* pthread library
* allegro 4 library

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository
2. Change to the project directory
3. Compile the C code using the provided Makefile

## Command section
When you launch the application, you will find a button labeled "COMMAND SECTION" in the user interface. Click on this button to access the command section, where you can explore and utilize various commands available in the simulation.

The command section provides an interface to send specific commands for controlling the motors and other functionalities of the demo. By interacting with this section, you can experiment with different commands to control the movement and behavior of the simulated motors.

Take some time to explore the command section and familiarize yourself with the available commands and their effects on the simulation. It is an essential tool for customizing and interacting with the demo according to your preferences and requirements.
